# IoT Door Sign

Basically the other day I found this guy at the flea market that was selling old neon sign letters.
I bought one and decided to stuff leds into it that would mimic my hearth beat.
I wear a Fitbit with HR sensor, I just needed to get the data out of it using the Fitbit API.

This repo contains all the scripts and files that are needed in my server to update the database.
